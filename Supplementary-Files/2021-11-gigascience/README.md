## Supplementary Files 
Supplementary files for the publication: Interpretable Network Propagation with Application to Expanding the Repertoire of Human Proteins that Interact with SARS-CoV-2 in GigaScience by Law _et al._

- File S1: The prediction rank and p-value computed by RL and SVM for each human protein on the STRING network, the list of drugs that target the protein (when this information is available in DrugBank), and the top-2 contributing SARS-CoV-2 interactors and corresponding SARS-CoV-2 protein. For the last piece of information, we also included the fraction of score contributed by the top-2 SARS-CoV-2 interactors.
- File S2: Enrichment results for RL,SVM and the viral interactors on GO biological processes.
- File S3: Provenance tracing matrix of contributions to the network propagation score from each SARS-CoV-2 interactor to every top-ranking protein.
